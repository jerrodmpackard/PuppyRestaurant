+ Peer Review Critique:
+ Home page image is not taking the whole page-width as the mockup, and the footer logo/address is not aligned with the columns  above it.
+ About page: the "hamburger" menu is not working in this page; the navbar and the footer is not aligning with the page containers espesically when trying responsiveness; the gap between the contents and the screen side is wide in my opinion
+ Menu page: while in 1920x1020 screen look everything is aligned, but in responsiveness mode the menu items are not aligning and images are disapearing(I think by design but i think you could keep them; just adjust size "in my opinion").
+ Catering page: everything is aligned in full and mobile sizes; but inbetween the sizes  the middle left image is not aligning with the right "column". 
+ Photo page: I didn't find any major issue with this page.

+ But Overall An amazing site with very few flaws with responsiveness. In the desktop size, the site is close to the design of the mockup!  great work keep it up!
